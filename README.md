# Command-Line Application

## Overview

This is a command-line application that allows users to select various operations and execute them on user-provided input. The program presents a menu of operations and performs corresponding checks based on the user's selection. The application continues running until the user selects the "Exit" option.

## Features

### User Interaction:
- The program displays a menu with a list of available operations.
- The user can choose an operation by entering the corresponding number.
- The user is prompted to enter a string or input for analysis.

### Operations:
- **Palindrome Check**: Determines if the input is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- **Lowercase Check**: Verifies if all characters in the input string are lowercase.
- **Digit Check**: Checks if all characters in the input are digits.
- **Length Check**: Checks if the length of the input exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Empty Check**: Verifies if the input string is empty.
- **Exit Program**: Provides an option to exit the application gracefully.

## Execution Flow:
1. The user selects an operation from the menu.
2. The user provides input to be analyzed.
3. The application performs the selected operation and displays the result.
4. If the operation is invalid, the user is informed and prompted to try again.
5. The program will continue running until the user selects the "Exit" option.
